## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data for Retail and Food Services in the U.S.A. The data has been collected from the U.S. government website, which ensures its authenticity and reliability. The dataset includes information such as NAICS code, category, sales figures, geographical regions, and time period (e.g., monthly or yearly).

## Database
To facilitate data management and analysis, a SQL database has been created to store the dataset. SQL provides a robust and efficient way to query and manipulate the data. The database schema has been designed to ensure proper organization and ease of use. The structure of the database enables seamless integration with various data visualization tools.

## Data Processing
The data obtained from the U.S. government website might require some preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. SQL queries have been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.


## Dashboard
The core component of this project is the interactive dashboard, which provides insightful visualizations of the sales data. The dashboard showcases trends, patterns, and comparisons based on NAICS codes and categories. It allows users to explore the data from different perspectives and gain valuable insights.

## The dashboard features include:

**Overview:** A summary of key performance indicators, such as total sales, top-performing categories, and regional distribution of sales.

**Sales by NAICS Code:** Visual representations of sales figures for various NAICS codes, allowing users to identify the most significant contributors to overall sales.

**Sales by Category:** Graphs and charts illustrating sales for different categories within Retail and Food Services.

**Geographical Analysis:** Maps and charts showing sales distribution across different regions of the U.S.A.

T**ime Series Analysis:** Trends and seasonal patterns in sales data, helping users to identify patterns over time.

**Filtering and Interactivity:** Interactive elements allowing users to filter data based on specific criteria and perform ad-hoc analysis.

## Technologies Used
**SQL:** For data extraction, transformation, and loading into the database.

**Database Management System:** PostgreSQL to host and manage the dataset.

**Data Visualization Tools:** Power BI for creating the interactive dashboard.

**Programming Languages:** Python & SQL for data processing and scripting.

**How to Use the Dashboard**
Access the dashboard through a web link or a locally hosted application.

Explore the various visualizations and charts available on the dashboard.

Utilize interactive features like filtering, zooming, and sorting to perform in-depth analysis.

Extract valuable insights from the presented data and use them for informed decision-making.

**Conclusion**
The Sales for Retail and Food Services in U.S.A. project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data within the Retail and Food Services sectors. The use of SQL and data from the U.S. government website ensures data accuracy and reliability. The interactive dashboard offers a user-friendly interface to explore the data visually and gain valuable insights.
